#  AirBnB clone - Web static
## HTML/CSS
Open web technologies (such as HTML and CSS) have three most peculiar particularities compared to other technologies:

* Because anyone is meant to be allowed to code an interpreter for those languages (that what browsers are!), people making decisions on those technologies are part of an open consortium of companies (called the W3C), which operates on consensus; therefore they evolve rather slowly.
* Reverse compatibility is among the most important values kept in mind when deciding on evolutions, because newest browsers should keep being able to run older websites, and older browsers should be able to access newest websites.
* They were not initially designed to make applications or well-designed pages, but just display research documents; while they have come a long way since then, it is visible in the ways things are done.

For each of those three reasons, it is quite important, in order to understand what those technologies are made of today, to understand where they come from, and the legacy that comes with them.

### Web static
Before developing a big and complex web application, we will build the front end step-by-step.

The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

* Create simple HTML static pages
* Style guide
* Fake contents
* No Javascript
* No data loaded from anything

During this project, one learns how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of your page, it should be the first thing one writes. CSS is the styling of your page, the design.
